        <p> This, this is my heaven. My family owns a cottage in Lake Okanagan in BC. My Grandfather bought two pieces of real estate back in the 70's the <em>"cottage"</em> you see in the picture was my Granfather's dream home. It has the weirdest layout; a bookshelf that surrounds his living room with books and artifacts from his world travels to a hot tub in the middle of his bedroom overlooking the lake. The kids cabin, for his nine children, 25 grandkids and 8 great grandkids is not in the picture you see above. It is your average cottage with fun memorabilia from the <strong>70's, 80's, 90's</strong> all over the place, including the roof. If I am lucky I get out to the cottage every second summerMy claim to fame is my signature from 1998 <em>"Brit Rocks"</em> so insightful for a seven year old.</p>

        <p> Now, The Falls are a secret <ins>(SHHHHH!)</ins> just up the road from our slice of paradise. To venture to these waterfalls you need guts, and as the years went on a beer to calm the nerves. After climbing 3000 stairs you reach the top of the scenic Fintry National Park view. However, for an adventure is not scenic enough. Hop the railing, shimmy like Super Mario across a caged in fence that says <strong><ins>DO NOT ENTER</ins></strong>, and you're not even close to being there. You have to cross this rickety wooden bride from the Klondike Day’s that’s only about 12 feet long and 2 feet wide. I forgot to mention there are waterfalls that fall 400 feet to your death on both sides of you. Scale down a small but steep cliff and your there. I'm getting better at it but I still need a guide and I don’t look down. The secret waterfall you reach is incredible and worth what you put your mind and body through to get there.</p>

        <p>This is 34 Fairview Street in Antigonish Nova Scotia, this home held <strong> 7 members </strong> of my second family. <ins>Four boys, three girls and the best year of my twenty-something life.</ins><em>This Home</em> was a home, it was a mess, it was hard to go home to some days but man I miss walking in that door. It was like walking into Cheer's <em>(1980's TV Show, and bar)</em>, there was always someone to sit down with, eat with, have a drink with <em>(or a Quart with)</em> and be the most raw form of yourself around. Anyone and everyone was welcome. We were a well-greased dysfunctional machine, that worked together and helped pick each other up. Nights would start and end by chanting; <em><strong>"We will live forever"</em></strong> like royalty. This address is my favorite place in that little town and I love that little town. A piece of my heart rests at 34 Fairview</p>

            <p> This couch was on our front porch the day we moved in, our no good landlord said we had to get rid of it and gave us a number of a guy we could pay <em>(I still have 'Lance Couch Guy' in my phone)</em>. As you can see, the couch stuck around and it was the best couch anyone could ever ask for. Now, I talk about it like its an old dog but it had the qualities of a four legged friend as it couldn’t talk but was it ever happy to see you when you got home. It was the most forgiving piece of <em></em>(outdoor)</em> furniture and man was it comfy. From Spring to Spring it stayed right there on the deck. I've studied on that couch, I've napped on that couch, I've wrestled on that couch, I've cried on that couch, I met my first and current love on that couch. It was good to me &amp; my family. <strong>God rest its soul.</strong> </p>

        <p>Spring Garden Road is home to a number of pubs; coffee shops and boutiques, making it busy both day and night. It's home to the <strong><ins>Halifax Public Gardens</ins></strong> which are beautiful to walk through. Halifax is one of those city's you can travel by foot &amp;can get end to end in an hour and a half. Maybe you can do it in under an hour, but those <ins>gardens</ins> stop you in your tracks. I’ve spent a lot of time in Halifax and I'm not sure what it is or if something is in the air but it feels like a weight is lifted from my chest when I'm there. Home to the grave of Alexander Keith and the Splitcrow, Halifax has always been good to me. It's my favorite place to visit and I hope to raise a family of my own there one day.</p>

        <p> This is the museum on Main Street in Arnprior. My Grandfather was the Mayor of Arnprior and this was his favorite building. My mom grew up in Arnprior and most of my family still does. As a kid we spent our weekends there - visiting still brings me back to my awesome childhood with my cousins running all over town. Something about Arnprior is <em>calming</em>; my favorite time to visit is in the fall. It's calm and quiet and I get to spend down time with my family, that's why Arnprior is on my map of places I have fallen in love with.</p>

        <p><em>The Grove</em> is well a grove at the end of my grandparent’s street. It's the street my mom and I guess I grew up on. When our parents would get tired of us they would tell us to go play in the grove. We would play in this forest for hours, its like we owned it. If you followed the path all the way to the end you would end up at the beach. It was magical in the fall and still is. It's nice that something’s stay untouched, this is one of those things.</p>

        <p> <em>The Cape George Lighthouse</em> is found on the cusp of Antigonish County, Nova Scotia on your way to Cape Breton and looks over the waters of St. George’s Bay. The present lighthouse was built in <strong>1968</strong> but the original lighthouse was built in <strong>1861</strong>. It stands approximately 360 feet above the bay and both Cape Breton and Prince Edward Island are visible with a clear horizon. It would get to that time of the school year where we would just need a break, a break from school a break from reality, from everything this is where we would adventure. My name may or may not be found on the base of this structure along with many others. The best place to breath in the cold Atlantic air, toss a football and roam aimlessly.</p>
